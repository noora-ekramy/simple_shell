## Introduction

Welcome to the Simple Shell Program, an elegant and efficient Unix-like shell inspired by the Thompson Shell.

The Simple Shell Program distinguishes itself through its dedication to customization and optimization, avoiding heavy reliance on existing tools. Our extensive use of low-level C programming ensures efficiency and reliability, making our shell a valuable resource for system programmers. In essence, our project reflects our dedication to excellence and craftsmanship in the world of Unix-like shells.

## Environment

The shell program has been developed and tested on the following environment:

- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04

## Allowed Functions

The shell program utilizes the following functions, all implemented in C:

- access
- chdir
- close
- closedir
- execve
- exit
- _exit
- fflush
- fork
- free
- getcwd
- getpid
- isatty
- kill
- malloc
- open
- opendir
- perror
- read
- readdir
- signal
- stat (__xstat)
- lstat (__lxstat)
- fstat (__fxstat)
- wait
- waitpid
- wait3
- wait4
- write

Additionally, the shell program implements the following functions from scratch:
- cd 
- setenv
- unsetenv
- env
- _atoi
- _putchar
- _strcat
- _strcmp
- _strcpy
- _strcspn
- _strdup
- _strlen
- _strtok
- _getline

These functions are used to implement various functionalities of the shell program and interact with the operating system.

## Key Features

- **Interactive, Non-Interactive, and File Input Modes:**
  - Interactive mode allows users to enter commands and receive real-time output.
  - Non-interactive mode reads commands from a file, executing them without a prompt.
  - File input mode is supported with the usage: `simple_shell [filename]`, one command per line.

- **Error Handling:** 
  - Comprehensive error handling gracefully manages various scenarios, including command not found errors and exceptions.

- **Command Execution:** 
  - The shell executes external commands by locating executables in the system's PATH.
  - It avoids unnecessary forking if a command doesn't exist.

- **Built-In Commands:** 
  - Supports built-in commands like `cd`, `exit`, `env`, `setenv`, and `unsetenv`.

- **Signal Handling:** 
  - Handles signals such as Ctrl-C (SIGINT) to prevent unintended termination.

- **Argument Parsing:** 
  - Allows users to provide arguments with commands for more complex executions.

- **Exit Status:** 
  - Maintains exit statuses and supports the `exit` command to exit the shell with a specified status.

- **Custom `getline` Function:** 
  - Implements a custom `getline` function for efficient input reading.
  - Uses a buffer to minimize calls to the `read` system call and employs static variables.

- **Handling the PATH:** 
  - Manages the system's PATH variable to locate and execute external commands efficiently.

These features make the shell versatile and efficient, capable of handling various use cases and providing a user-friendly interface.


## How to Use

To experience the power and flexibility of this shell, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/noora-ekramy/simple_shell.git
```
2. Change your current directory to the project directory:
```bash
$ cd simple_shell
```
3. Compile the program using the provided Makefile. This will create the `hsh` binary:
```bash
$ make
```
4. Run the shell by executing the compiled binary:
```bash
$./hsh
```
Now, you're ready to begin using the `hsh` shell to execute commands and manage processes.
